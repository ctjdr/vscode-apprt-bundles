# 0.4.0

This version consequently improves navigation between code and manifest of a bundle.

* **[Fix deprecation warnings](#fix-deprecation-warnings)** - XXX.

## Fix deprecation warnings

In `manifest.json` files, execute the "Go to Definition" command on the name or `"impl"` property value of a component to open the corresponding implementation file.
This is equivalent to a `Ctrl-Click` or pressing `F12`.

!["Go to Definition" for components](../images/feature_component_goto_declaration.gif)

This works for components where the `"name"` or `"impl"` property matches the file name of a `.js` or `.ts` file inside the bundle folder.
But sometimes the component is mapped to another source file in the `module.js`.
In that case executing the command has no effect.
